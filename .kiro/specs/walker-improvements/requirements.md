# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the improvements needed for the Walker tool - a Node.js package analyzer that scans directory structures to identify and analyze JavaScript/Node.js packages for their module system support. The current implementation has several gaps in error handling, user experience, performance, and extensibility that need to be addressed to make it production-ready.

The improvements will transform Walker from a basic proof-of-concept into a robust, user-friendly CLI tool that developers can rely on for package ecosystem analysis and ESM/CommonJS migration planning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Error Handling

**User Story:** As a developer using Walker on various codebases, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I can get useful feedback even when encountering problematic files or directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool encounters a permission denied error THEN it SHALL log a warning and continue processing other directories
2. WHEN the tool encounters a corrupted JSON file THEN it SHALL log an error with the file path and continue processing
3. WHEN the tool encounters an inaccessible directory THEN it SHALL log a warning and skip that directory
4. WHEN the tool encounters any file system error THEN it SHALL provide meaningful error messages with context
5. IF a critical error occurs that prevents continuation THEN the tool SHALL exit with appropriate error codes and messages

### Requirement 2: Command Line Interface and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Walker's behavior through command-line options, so that I can customize the analysis for different use cases and projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run Walker with `--help` THEN it SHALL display usage instructions and available options
2. WHEN I specify a target directory with `--path <directory>` THEN it SHALL scan that directory instead of the current directory
3. WHEN I use `--exclude <pattern>` THEN it SHALL skip directories matching the glob pattern
4. WHEN I use `--max-depth <number>` THEN it SHALL limit directory traversal to the specified depth
5. WHEN I use `--output <format>` THEN it SHALL output results in the specified format (text, json, csv)
6. WHEN I use `--quiet` THEN it SHALL suppress non-essential output
7. WHEN I use `--verbose` THEN it SHALL show detailed progress and debug information
8. WHEN I use `--version` THEN it SHALL display the current version number

### Requirement 3: Modular Code Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining Walker, I want the code to be organized into logical modules, so that it's easier to understand, test, and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN it SHALL be organized into separate modules for different concerns
2. WHEN looking at the main.rs file THEN it SHALL only contain the main function and high-level orchestration
3. WHEN examining modules THEN each SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all public functions SHALL have documentation comments
5. IF a module becomes too large THEN it SHALL be further subdivided into logical sub-modules

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Package Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing my project's dependencies, I want Walker to provide comprehensive package information beyond just ESM/CommonJS support, so that I can make informed decisions about package usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a package THEN it SHALL detect TypeScript support via `types` or `typings` fields
2. WHEN analyzing a package THEN it SHALL report Node.js version requirements from `engines` field
3. WHEN analyzing a package THEN it SHALL identify browser compatibility via `browser` field
4. WHEN analyzing a package THEN it SHALL report license information
5. WHEN analyzing a package THEN it SHALL count and categorize dependencies (dev, peer, optional)
6. WHEN analyzing exports field THEN it SHALL handle complex conditional exports correctly

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer working with large codebases, I want Walker to complete analysis quickly even on projects with thousands of packages, so that I can use it regularly without significant delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning large directories THEN it SHALL process multiple directories concurrently
2. WHEN calculating package sizes THEN it SHALL provide an option to skip size calculation for faster scanning
3. WHEN encountering the same package multiple times THEN it SHALL cache analysis results
4. WHEN processing large node_modules directories THEN it SHALL complete within reasonable time limits
5. IF scanning takes longer than expected THEN it SHALL display progress indicators

### Requirement 6: Improved User Experience

**User Story:** As a developer using Walker, I want clear, actionable output and feedback, so that I can quickly understand the analysis results and any issues that occurred.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN it SHALL display what directory is being scanned
2. WHEN processing takes time THEN it SHALL show progress indicators with current status
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN it SHALL display a summary with key statistics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN it SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
5. WHEN using different output formats THEN each SHALL be properly formatted and complete
6. IF no packages are found THEN it SHALL inform the user with helpful suggestions

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to Walker, I want comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and prevent regressions, so that changes can be made confidently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN it SHALL have unit tests for all core functions
2. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL cover error conditions and edge cases
3. WHEN testing package analysis THEN it SHALL include tests with various package.json configurations
4. WHEN testing CLI functionality THEN it SHALL include integration tests for command-line options
5. WHEN adding new features THEN they SHALL include corresponding tests

### Requirement 8: Output Format Flexibility

**User Story:** As a developer integrating Walker into CI/CD pipelines, I want multiple output formats, so that I can process the results programmatically or generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `--output json` THEN it SHALL produce valid JSON with complete package information
2. WHEN using `--output csv` THEN it SHALL produce CSV format suitable for spreadsheet analysis
3. WHEN using `--output text` THEN it SHALL produce human-readable colored output (default)
4. WHEN using any output format THEN it SHALL include all analyzed package information
5. IF outputting to a file THEN it SHALL support the `--output-file <path>` option

### Requirement 9: Configuration File Support

**User Story:** As a developer working on multiple projects, I want to save Walker configuration in a file, so that I can maintain consistent analysis settings across different runs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a `.walker.toml` file exists in the current directory THEN it SHALL load configuration from it
2. WHEN command-line options conflict with config file THEN command-line options SHALL take precedence
3. WHEN using `--config <path>` THEN it SHALL load configuration from the specified file
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages about what's wrong
5. IF no configuration file exists THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults

### Requirement 10: Documentation and Help

**User Story:** As a new user of Walker, I want comprehensive documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use the tool effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `walker --help` THEN it SHALL display comprehensive usage information with examples
2. WHEN examining the repository THEN it SHALL include a detailed README with installation and usage instructions
3. WHEN looking at the code THEN all public APIs SHALL have documentation comments
4. WHEN using complex features THEN the documentation SHALL include practical examples
5. IF the tool has configuration options THEN they SHALL be documented with their effects and valid values
